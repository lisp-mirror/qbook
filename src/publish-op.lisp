;;;; * ASDF Integration

;;;; The publish-op generates documentation from the ASDF system
;;;; definition. The op creates a qbook html file next to the .asd
;;;; file. The default values for the parameters passed to
;;;; PUBLISH-QBOOK (input-file, output-file and title) are all taken
;;;; from the ASDF system. Customizing the defaults is a simple matter
;;;; of passing the proper keywords to asdf:oos.
